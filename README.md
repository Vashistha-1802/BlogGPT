Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling
developers to build applications that they previously could not.
We have used Cohere.ai developed models to create a web application using stramlit library for many known script generations like movie script, song lyrics, story generation, poem generation, blog post generation
In our current situation we have given the access to the functionalities limited to `write_post` ,`writez_poem`, `write_story`
